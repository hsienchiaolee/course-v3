       "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

That model has been trained to guess what the next word is, its input being all the previous words. It has a recurrent structure and a hidden state that is updated each time it sees a new word. This hidden state thus contains information about the sentence up to that point.\n",

Plus there might be some words that would be extremely common in the reviews dataset but would be barely present in wikipedia, and therefore might not be part of the vocabulary the model was trained on."

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj first , the writing apparently came from an eight - grader who barely knew anything about xxmaj ed 's history and cranked out the script in about 20 minutes . xxmaj the movie completely passes over the most interesting facets of xxmaj ed and his relationship with his mother ( not to mention what the real police found in his house ) and decides to focus primarily on the young deputy who looks like he just wandered onto the set . xxmaj likewise , all of the male characters seem to be ad - libbing their dialog throughout the entire movie . i 'm not exaggerating . \n",

       "  xxmaj do n't even get me started with the historical goofs in this movie . xxmaj seriously , who the hell directed this ? xxmaj this movie is supposed to take place around 1957 , but the cops are carrying modern side - handled xxunk , some of the stuff in the hardware store look like they came from xxmaj lowes , and when the cop gets to a payphone he dials 9 - 1 - 1 ( did n't exist back then ) . xxmaj also , xxmaj ed was a small guy , scary like xxmaj anthony xxmaj perkins ' character in xxmaj psycho ( who was supposedly based on real - life xxmaj ed ) , not this burly dude who ended up looking way too much like the bad guy in xxmaj men xxmaj in xxmaj black . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj another thing that really bugged me was the appearance that the makers of this film shot the whole thing in an abandoned , 3 building set . xxmaj because of the \" clever \" camera angles , you never see any actual town , and the interior of the sets looked like old , long - abandoned shacks . xxmaj pop a cash register on a saw - horse and xxunk hardware store . \n",
       " \n",
       "  i 'm usually pretty forgiving of low - budget horror films , but this one just begs for it . xxmaj all you had to do was include most of the real events ( even embellish them ! ) , pay five good actors instead of 15 crappy ones , and for xxmaj pete 's sake take 5 minutes and think about the time period once in a while . xxmaj my advice : xxmaj google xxmaj ed xxmaj gein , you 'll be far more entertained .,xxbos xxmaj aside from a few good moments of fairly raw violence , this painful film is most notable for making 68 minutes seem like two hours . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj it starts with an interminably long intro where the xxmaj leeds family is introduced , including two insufferable tykes and their adult brother and sister , completely clichéd xxmaj pa and xxmaj ma , and incredibly annoying xxmaj grandpa ( played by xxmaj charles \" xxmaj chic \" xxmaj sales ) . xxmaj while sitting down to dinner the family is disturbed by the sounds of gunfire , and rushes to the window in time to see two men gunned down by mobsters in the street . xxmaj the mobsters flee through the family 's house , leaving them as witnesses to the crime . \n",

       "  xxmaj the rest of the movie consists of xxmaj walter xxmaj huston as the crusading xxup da occasionally interrupting long anti - crime speeches to make half hearted attempts at trying to protect the family from the mob . xxmaj it all winds up in a predictable manner . \n",

       "  xxmaj good points about the movie include a couple of decent shootouts and a truly nasty beating , xxmaj nat xxmaj pendleton as one of the mobsters , and the gorgeous xxmaj sue xxmaj blane in a small role as the xxmaj leeds daughter . \n",
